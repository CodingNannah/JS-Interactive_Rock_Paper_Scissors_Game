This is a User vs. Computer "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, which I created after practicing Dave Gray's JS Tutorial for Beginners #1 through #11.

To Run This Game in Windows:
1. Download these files and open them in VSC with the Live Server extension
2. Open a Chrome Browser (about:blank)
3. Use ctrl + shift + J to open the console
4. Click on "Go Live" at the bottom of VSC
5. The first game will automatically display in the console.
6. To "play" again, refresh the browser.

Game Creation Notes:

I followed the tutorial and borrowed code from My Third JS Rock, Paper, Scissors Game. As such, this version uses Ternary Operator conditionals.

I added the User Input for a Name and called the Player by it throughout. 

Problem-solving: I had to move some variables to make certain they were initiating in the right places for the game to function properly.

Problem unsolved: I don't like asking the player TWICE to play again and force the input of their name AGAIN. location.reload() is boolean, and reload's the entire page/game. I went down a rabbit hole of options. It seems I need a GET method and function. I see why Dave skipped this for beginners.

I finally noticed that the variable "name" was deprecated and adjusted accordingly.
